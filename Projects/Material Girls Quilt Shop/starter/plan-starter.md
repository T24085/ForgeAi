## Style Notes
Use a light, airy color palette with muted earth tones to reflect quilting fabrics. Typography: a modern sans-serif for body text and a decorative serif for headings to hint at craft. Responsive layout with large hero image, grid product thumbnails, and easy navigation. Minimal animations (fade-in) for load performance. Icons can be simple line art. Ensure accessibility with proper contrast and alt text for media.
