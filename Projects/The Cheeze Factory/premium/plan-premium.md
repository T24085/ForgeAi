# Plan (The Cheeze Factory - Premium)

## Summary
A premium, high-end website for The Cheeze Factory that balances playful brand personality with sophisticated design. The site serves as both an informational showcase (cheese history, production process) and a conversion engine (reservations, ordering, location). The design prioritizes typography-driven elegance, restrained color usage, and subtle motion to create an expensive-feeling experience.

## Style Notes
The design philosophy: 'Elevated Playfulness'—bold, playful personality treated with serious craft. Primary fonts: Playfair Display (Serif, Display) for headings and dramatic statements; DM Sans (Sans-Serif, Body) for readable, modern text. The font pairing creates an elegant foundation for the playful cheese theme without feeling juvenile. All text should have generous line length (60-70 characters), high-contrast headings (weight 600+), and consistent tracking. Avoid decorative fonts for body—prioritize readability and professionalism.

## Assets Needed
- Hero imagery (dramatic cheese photography, hero product shot)
- Product photography (15-20 premium cheese images)
- Production process illustrations (diagrams or photos)
- Trust badges (certifications, awards)
- Testimonial avatars and quotes
- Icon set (navigation, social, feature icons)
- Brand colors (4-6 hex codes with variations)
- Texture overlays (subtle gradients for premium feel)
