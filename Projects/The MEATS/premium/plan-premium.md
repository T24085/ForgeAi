## Style Notes
Display Font: Playfair Display (Serif, premium, bold, strong typographic presence) - Headlines, Hero, Section Titles. Body Font: DM Sans (Sans-serif, clean, highly readable, modern) - Body copy, navigation, labels. Visual Direction: Dark mode base (#0f0f0f) with deep red accents (#8B0000) and gold (#D4AF37) for premium feel. Generous whitespace (spacing rhythm: 8px base → 24px, 48px, 96px). Motion: Subtle 300ms ease transitions, no flashing or chaotic effects - premium feel requires intention over flashiness. Cards: Glassmorphism with slight transparency + backdrop blur, rounded corners (12px), border gradients. Buttons: Gold gradient backgrounds with hover lift + shadow, clear CTAs. Contrast rules: WCAG AA compliant text contrast ratios, dark backgrounds require light text (white/cream). Motion style: Smooth reveal animations (fade-up), staggered content entry, parallax on hero imagery.
