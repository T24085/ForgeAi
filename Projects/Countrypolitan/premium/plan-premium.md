## Style Notes
Use a sophisticated, rustic color palette (deep browns, muted golds, sage greens). Typography: elegant serif for headings (e.g., Playfair Display) and clean sans‑serif for body text (e.g., Lato). Apply subtle parallax scroll effects, fade‑in animations, and CSS3 hover transitions. Implement responsive design with mobile‑first approach. Use a 16:9 hero video or high‑resolution images with lazy‑loading. Include dark mode toggle as optional premium feature.
