# Plan (Countrypolitan - Business)

## Summary
A polished, brand‑centric website for Countrypolitan that showcases its unique blend of antique, home, and garden furnishings.

## Style Notes
Rustic country vibe: warm earth tones (deep browns, muted greens, terracotta), textured wood backgrounds, linen‑like accents. Typography: serif for headings (e.g., Playfair Display), clean sans‑serif for body (e.g., Open Sans). Use high‑contrast dark text on light backgrounds with subtle drop shadows. Hover effects on buttons with soft color transitions. Mobile‑first responsive grid, 12‑column layout, accessible color contrast.
