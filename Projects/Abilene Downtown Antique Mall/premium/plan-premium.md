## Style Notes
Use a warm, earthy color palette (deep browns, terracotta, muted gold) to reflect antiques. Incorporate handcrafted typography (serif with subtle flourishes) and custom iconography inspired by vintage signs. Animations should be subtle (fade‑in, slide‑up, scroll‑triggered parallax) to enhance storytelling without distracting. Mobile‑first responsive design with touch‑friendly interactions. Include micro‑interactions on buttons, form fields, and dealer profile reveals.
