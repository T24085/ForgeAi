  "style_notes": "Use a warm, earthy color palette (deep browns, terracotta, muted gold) to reflect antiques. Incorporate handcrafted typography (serif with subtle flourishes) and custom iconography inspired by vintage signs. Animations should be subtle (fade\u2011in, slide\u2011up, scroll\u2011triggered parallax) to enhance storytelling without distracting. Mobile\u2011first responsive design with touch\u2011friendly interactions. Include micro\u2011interactions on buttons, form fields, and dealer profile reveals.",
